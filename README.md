# Basic Calculator

This is a simple command-line calculator written in Python. It performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features

- Addition (`+`)
- Subtraction (`-`)
- Multiplication (`*`)
- Division (`/`) with error handling for division by zero
- Handles floating-point and integer inputs

## Error Handling

- The program will prompt an error if an invalid operation is entered.
- Division by zero is handled with a message indicating that division by zero is not allowed.

## Future Improvements

- Add support for more operations like modulus (`%`) and exponentiation (`**`).
- Implement input validation for non-numeric values.
- Add a loop to perform multiple operations without restarting the program.
